**hctjs** is a Javascript library for dynamic color theming, forked from Google's excellent [material-color-utilities](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities) project. It provides utilities for color science and dynamic color scheme generation, based on the principles of Material Design 3.

This fork, **hctjs**, is maintained and distributed under the **MIT License**.

## Key Features

*   **Dynamic Color Schemes:** Generates comprehensive and harmonious color schemes from a single seed color, adapting to light and dark modes and different contrast levels.
*   **Material Design 3 Implementation:**  Based on the latest Material Design 3 color guidance and algorithms.
*   **Color Science Foundation:** Leverages advanced color spaces like HCT and CAM16 for perceptually accurate color manipulation.
*   **Color Quantization:** Includes algorithms for reducing color palettes while maintaining visual fidelity.
*   **Flexible and Extensible:** Designed to be customizable and adaptable for various UI theming needs.
